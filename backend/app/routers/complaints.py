"""
CampusLens - HTTP layer for the three audiences.

Route groups:
  /api/complaints/*   the caller's own complaints
  /api/admin/*        every complaint, scores, confirmations  (admin only)
  /api/public/*       approved sanitized feed              (no auth)
  /api/health         liveness                              (no auth)

Authorisation notes
-------------------
* Identity always comes from ``auth.current_identity`` / ``auth.current_admin``,
  which verify the JWT and read the role from the database. No route trusts a
  role, student id or admin flag supplied by the client.
* RLS is enforced in PostgreSQL. Where a student must be confined to their own
  rows the query is additionally filtered by the verified user id, so
  authorisation does not rest on the policy alone.
* A complaint the caller may not see returns 404, not 403: the existence of
  another student's complaint is not disclosed.
